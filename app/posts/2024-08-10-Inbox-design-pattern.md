## Inbox pattern
Inbox design patterns for mail or notifications are common in commercial applications. The most pervasive patterns are a three-panel fluid layout for large & medium-sized screens and tabbed navigation with card components representing discrete messages for mobile.

We're testing the possibility of a cross-government inbox pattern to enable more rapid communication between departments and citizens.

Several components within the design system could be used to build an inbox-type experience. Modern inbox patterns are quite complex, setting a high standard for user interaction. Similar to driving a car—which is complex but, once mastered, offers significant benefits—these inbox patterns may not be easy or intuitive at first (or even accessible). However, their continuous development and widespread use have made them the standard way to manage complex tasks.

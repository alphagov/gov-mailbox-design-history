## Where has this work come from?
Other countries, including Denmark, have a National Digital Post enabling cross-government and direct two-way communication for citizens and public authorities. This meets legal requirements around the delivery and receipt of official communications while enhancing the user experience. It is a keystone technology that provides several multiplier effects and a level of efficiency that allows a highly responsive and even proactive approach to government delivery of services.

Working with the main supplier responsible for the Danish Digital Post, this project and design history aims to document the work done to validate the ability of such a system to fit within the GDS landscape.

## GDS Big Bets

## Danish mailbox
The [Danish National Digital Post](https://en.digst.dk/systems/digital-post/) solves a number of user needs on both sides of the platform, for citizens, departments & services.

As the mailbox was one of the starting points for digitisation it serves a number of core mailbox needs but also uses the mailbox as a platform to solve a number of the interconnected needs as well as additional service journeys through functionality as well as the legislation surrounding it.

- Statutory requirement for legal documents
- Forms and transactional services

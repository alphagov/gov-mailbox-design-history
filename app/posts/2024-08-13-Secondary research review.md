## Purpose of this work
As we started working on Citizen Mailbox, we wanted to understand what research has been done and what plans have been drafted on other GDS programmes and projects. This was to help us understand how Citizen Mailbox might fit that landscape.

The review examined available research and design histories from:
- GOV.UK app
- One Login
- Notify


### Important caveat
Conclusions are based on presentations and prototypes. Ambitions and roadmaps may have changed since documentation was created.

## Documentation
[Documented on Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVK4dX-IM=/)

### One Login

The scope / ambition of One Login as we currently understand it:

- signing in to gov services
- proving identity (One Login is saving the user’s proof of identity so it can be reused with other services in future)
- sharing core identity information with services e.g. DBS - user can say which elements should be shared
- informing linked services of contact detail changes
- enabling users to have different contact details for different aspects of their life (including name)
- managing addresses in One Login and expose potentially out-of-date information saved in other accounts / services
- saving information from other accounts into One Login e.g. NIN from DWP universal credit account
- providing directory of services
- allowing other services to request specific information e.g. qualification to drive
- one login wallet


### Gov.uk app

The scope / ambition of One Login as we currently understand it:

- wallet / storing documents  
- surfacing services you have used before  
- signing in to other accounts (e.g. benefit or childcare accounts)  
- services integrated with the app  
- sending users out of the app to find services on gov.uk  
- gov accounts linked  


#### Similarities

It seems that both the gov.uk app and One Login are potentially looking into wallet and document storing functionalities. Another area is around providing users with a way of accessing previously or frequently used services.


### Notify

There are three insights from this study, that are particularly relevant to Citizen Mailbox

Email is often the expected form of communication
Emails can feel more suited to transactions than texts
“Text message is a just, like, a side thing. Emails are important”
Email is used as a proof of important transitions.

This review helps identify teams for further discussions about Citizen Mailbox scope.

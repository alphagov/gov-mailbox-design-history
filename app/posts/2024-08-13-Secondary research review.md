## Why are we doing this?

Important caveat
It is important to acknowledge that we are making assumptions based on what platform teams have shared. We might not be completely accurate. Also ambitions and roadmaps change in time.

Documented it on Miro - https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVK4dX-IM=/

## One Login
- The scope / ambition of One Login as we currently understand it:
- signing in to gov services
- proving identity (One Login is saving the userâ€™s proof of identity so it can be reused with other services in future)
- sharing core identity information with services e.g. DBS - user can say which elements should be shared
- informing linked services of contact detail changes
- enabling users to have different contact details for different aspects of their life (including name)
- managing addresses in one login and expose potentially out-of-date information saved in other accounts / services
- saving information from other accounts into One Login e.g. NIN from DWP universal credit account
- providing directory of services
- allowing other services to request specific information e.g. qualification to drive
- one login wallet - possibly around adding different documents although not entirely clear


## Gov.uk app
- wallet / storing documents  
- services you have used before  
- signing in to other accounts (e.g. benefit or childcare accounts)  
- services integrated with the app  
- sending users out of the app to find services on gov.uk  
- gov accounts linked  
- based on the prototype: mail aspect is limited - seemingly only linked to alerts and not in the main nav, and only one way   
- need to understand more about the intention behind messaging  
- currently: NIN, DBS - only added from a service level  
- both app and one login offer functionality to view previously used services access via those channels  
- e.g. if you received a document via mailbox, would you choose to save it in the wallet / would it go there automatically / would it sit in mailbox (especially once it's dealt with)  



## Notify 

This work was a starting point for us trying to ascertain which user needs will likely be catered for by which platform and what the overlaps might be.
